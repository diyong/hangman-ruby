# Hangman Project

This is a project assigned at theodinproject.com.

The hangman project allowed me to solidify my grasp on classes, modules, and variable scope. However, I was excited to try my hand at incorporating JSON file generation and parsing. While the project did not specify which serialization method to use, I wanted to try my hand at using JSON specifically because it is widely used and it benchmarks well. I plan on using JSON extensibly in the future, but I would also like to try CSV, YAML, and Marshal.

I was also able to practice manipulating arrays, hashes, and strings. I have also learned quite a bit about catches/throws, exit's, colorizing text in the cli, and File I/O.
